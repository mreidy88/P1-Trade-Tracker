# P1-Trade-Tracker

This project aims to track the decisions made by NHL General Managers.
Through pulling stats from nhlapi and sportapi, this project will be able to analyze
the trade decisions and provide an unbiased view of the quality of trade.  
Through the analysis,
teams will also be evaluated by their performance utilizing winning percentage, goals for avg, goals
against avg.  
Players will be evaluated by their 
goals, assists, points, and +/-.  
Advanced analytics such as 
CORSI - at Even Strength Shots + Blocks + Misses (for and against) 
takeaway/giveaway
Possession Quality E+/- -- 'Expected +/-' given where shots came from, for and against, while this player was on the ice at even strength.  It's based on where the shots are coming from, compared to the league-wide shooting percentage for that shot location.

Availabilty concerns over advanced statistics may led to their exclusion from the project.

Notes will be made on trades involving draft picks.  Since this information will not
be available until after the regular season, projections will be used.

# Statistical Breakdown
Trades will be evaluated according to the following parameters:
Team place in standings
Team winning percentage before and after trade
Team goals for and goals against average before and after the trade
Player stats: plus/minus, goals, assists, total points and average before and after trade
CORSI
Possesion Quality

advanced player metrics may be used for a more thorough breakdown.  However, these
numbers may not be available for all players (ie: prospects involved in trade).
